        <p class="card-text">The LGBTQ+ community has a long and rich history, and the sad fact is, that is not as well known as it deserves to be. As I conducted user interviews, I learned that this is not only true, but is a problem, among community member and allies.

          It all started with creating a proto-persona based on research on demographics and possible user problems. Then, 5 user interviews were conducted, all of whom identified as either part of the LGBTQ+ community or an ally.
          
          After creating an affinity diagram, it was found that resources such as the CLGA were not well known. 3/5 users were familiar with LGBTQ+ nonprofits on a global scale, and none were familiar with their local organizations, including the CLGA. However, there was an overall desire among users to learn about the LGBTQ+ community’s history.</p>

      <p class="jumbo-body">If the website is redesigned and given distinct, memorable branding, it would be easier to use, and therefore it will be easier to make impressions on users who may be more likely to support or get involved with the organization.</p>

        prototype was not made However, I made the equivalent within a digital wireframe in Figma. I referred to my user flow to turn it into my clickable low-fidelity prototype.

      <p>The following feedback was received and iterated upon:</p>
        
      <ul>
        <li>Timeslot selection is unclear, confuses the user & disrupts the user flow</li>
        <li>Colour scheme scheme was too distracting, especially the button’s hover state</li>
        <li>Buttons were a bit large</li>
        <li>The calendar needed a clearer indication of being selected/active</li>
      </ul> 
      <br>
      <p>Then, A/B testing was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the prototype’s colour palette.</p>
      <p>Users were shown the following samples of the homepage design, and the majority preferred the pastel pink version, citing a sense of visual harmony and eye-pleasing contrast, compared to pastel yellow, which was said to tend to blend into the design more. Both samples can be seen below.</p>
